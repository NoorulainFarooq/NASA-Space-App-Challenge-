# NASA Space App Challenge: Tell Us a Climate Story 🌍❄️

This project shines a spotlight on **climate change** through the power of **data-driven storytelling**, highlighting the **glacial crisis** in Southeast Greenland. Using **NASA open data** and cutting-edge visualizations, we've created an **interactive dashboard** that reveals the profound impact of rising temperatures on glacier ice loss and its ripple effect on **global sea levels**. 🌡️🌊

### Key Features: 

1. **🌐 Interactive Dashboard**: Explore annual and seasonal glacier ice discharge, freshwater data, and cumulative ice loss in a dynamic way.
2. **🛰️ Data Sources**: Leverages satellite data from **NASA**, **USGS**, and **Copernicus** for a thorough analysis of glacial changes.
3. **📊 Insights**: Gain insights into the intricate relationship between **glacier melt**, **fjord salinity**, and **freshwater flux** through user-friendly visualizations.
4. **💻 Data Story Website**: Visit our website, where engaging narratives and visual data bring the story of Southeast Greenland’s glaciers to life, emphasizing the urgent need for climate action.
