# NASA-Space-App-Challenge-
Tell us a Climate Story:
This project aims to raise awareness about climate change through data-driven storytelling focused on the glacial crisis in Southeast Greenland. Utilizing NASA open data and advanced visualization techniques, we developed an interactive dashboard that showcases the impact of rising temperatures on glacier ice loss and its implications for global sea levels.

Key Features:

Interactive Dashboard: Visualize annual and seasonal glacier ice discharge, freshwater data, and cumulative ice loss.
Data Sources: Integrates satellite data from NASA, USGS, and Copernicus for comprehensive analysis.
Insights: Offers user-friendly exploration of the relationship between glacier melt, fjord salinity, and freshwater flux.
Data Story Website: Navigate our dedicated website, which presents engaging narratives supported by the data, helping to contextualize the significance 
of our findings and the urgency of climate action.

Objectives:

Educate users on the accelerating impacts of climate change.
Encourage collective action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Provide a platform for further research and analysis of glacial dynamics.

Join us in uncovering the compelling stories behind the data and advocating for a sustainable future!
